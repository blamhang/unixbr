Unix-Dump.sh
Unix-Dump gathers information about the system it is being run on.
Such information can be useful for an administrator to look at a system offline
and for a security analyst to perform checks for unix system build review.
Information gathered:
* Locating and copying config files on the host
* Running on-host commands and saving results to file
* Finding specific interesting files (and saving eventually those)
